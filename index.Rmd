>We would like to know if there is a correlation between **major sport events** and **depression** within the winning country. We have chosen the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the country of France aka *le pays des Champions du Monde*.

>...and we got the data from Google Trends.



# Loading libraries
***
We will only need `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(plotly)
```




# Loading data
***
We also host the data file on our Github, if you want to [check it out](https://github.com/huanlebui/DataVizProject/blob/master/data.csv).

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

data$week <- as.Date(data$week)

```



# A quick look into the data
***
We actually had two seperate CSV files so we merged them into one. Under the `depression` and `cdm` attributes we have the trending levels of the keywords **depression** (in terms of search queries) and **coupe du monde** (in terms of occurrences in newsfeeds) respectively, throughout the year of 2018 in France.

```{r}
head(data)
```
```{r}
summary(data)
```


# A primitive line chart
***
Let's look at the trending of the two keywords in 2018.

```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=week) ) +
    geom_line( aes(y = depression), color = "red" ) +
    geom_line( aes(y = cdm), color ="blue" ) +
    xlab("Time") +
    ylab("Trending")

```


We can observe a slight decrease during a relatively long period of time for the keyword **depression** around the month of July. And of course we can easily notice the obvious skyrocketing keyword **coupe du monde** between June and July.

```{r}
#Bubble_graph
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=week,y=depression,fill=depression, size=cdm) ) +
    geom_point(alpha=1, shape=21) +
    scale_fill_gradient(low="yellow", high="red")+
    theme_ipsum()
    



```

This graph allows us to  understand that when the score for the World cup is high, so during the competition, the depression rate is below the mean of year 2018.So we can deduce that world cup can reduce depression.
