# DataVizProject

## Who

This project is led by three brilliant students : Huan LE, Maël-Antoine GNANOU and Otmane M'BIDA.

## What

It analyzes the correlation between major sport events and (the decrease of) depression within the winning country.

## When/Where

The 2018 FIFA World Cup and the country of France have been chosen accordingly to the results of this event.

## How

The analysis is based on data found on Google Trend which gives the trending levels of keywords during a certain period of time and within a certain country. Then R Markdown is used via R Studio to write to code, to display some charts, to discuss some results. And then everything is pushed through Github Desktop to this very Github.
